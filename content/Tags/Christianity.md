It is the world's main religion, which is itself a great mystery. A Christian, as any real one will tell you, is an absurd and paradoxical thing to be.

Many faiths are perfectly logical. All is One, for example, satisfies the intellect completely. All is One which is the mind of God which is infinite. This has been my metaphysics and as I say it is sound.

Christianity, on the other hand, lives in an incomprehensibly bizarre cosmos. It's easy to accuse it of anthropomorphism, but quite impossible to prove that it is not the other way around. Either we are made in God's image or we make God in our imageâ€“that there exists a family resemblance can be concrete evidence for neither claim. At the end of the day, it must be a matter of preference. We do choose what we want to believe. 

At first glance, this may seem an arbitrary choice, having more to do with aesthetics than anything else. But in fact is is an ethical question. All are aware on some level that this reality is [[Fractals|fractal]]. Our beliefs about the ultimate reality reflect how we choose to live within it. The Christian believes that the universe is all about love and doing the right thing and becoming perfect in union with God. And so they live. 

Others believe that God is infinite bliss of the self, and this is what they strive for. 

Still others believe that the universe is probably some kind of computer [[Chocolate Eggs|simulation]], and sure enough they spend all of their time on the computer. 

Indigenous people all around the world live in harmony with nature, and their cosmology emphasizes the interconnectivity of all. 

There is a two-way relationship between your metaphysics and way of life. Both are lately up to you, but there is still some influence from your culture. Those who inherit a dead lifestyle and uncritically accept it are prone to take refuge in nihilism. 

But the mystery is that Christianity won. Nobody could have seen this coming. They were one small cult against the greatest empire in history. When Jesus was crucified, Rome was at its apex and seemed unassailable. Yet the seed was planted and nowadays Rome is first and foremost a Jesus-place.

How did anyone get converted? [[Conversion is a miracle]], always. This is really one of the strongest pieces of evidence for Christianity because to convince someone of such an absurd and paradoxical thing is itself a miracle, and it is a documented fact that this miracle has been performed over and over again in the most unlikely of places and to the most unlikely of people. 

As for me, I love Jesus and I believe his spirit is present in the world. I would like to become a Christian...but this is not something to take lightly. It is probably the hardest thing in the world.
