[[Human Nature]]

Living things enjoy a unity of purpose. There is no separation between body and mind; both are instruments of the same. 

Every form evolves to fulfill a function. The tiger pounces, the deer flees, the flea sucks, the spider weaves. All live and move in the world and do their thing, seamless extensions of the ecosystem, entangled with all, the conditions of the incarnation defined by their bonds of relationship.

We are no different.
