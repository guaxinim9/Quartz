**Vines grow into a clenched fist which in turn encrypts a strange green diamond. Best not mention the cost, it’s not classy to blab. Besides, you can’t say the classic kind isn’t worth the carbon’s time. And we movers, waving the banner of our vaunted complexity? Yes indeed. Per universal law, our stone will be…more complex.**

How come we make believe?

Where is the line between metaphor and myth? 

Nobody believes that life is literally a box of chocolates, a selection of infinite possible experiences delicately arrayed to the aesthetic titillation of some all-named immortal? Well, why not? What could the omniscient conceivably find more novel than surprise? Suppose each chocolate represents the whole history of a given universe. Given–forget for now by whom, or call it random, which amounts ultimately to the same. The almighty pops the egg into the almaw, and becomes it, lives every life on every world, from beginning to end, singularity to singularity, all lives in time, a great ripping story in one stroke, dripping with meaning and symbolic potency, only a moment, from the consumer’s PoV. Now, this is sophisticated entertainment! And what is God to do but amuse himself? Is God to find himself, and worship himself? Is he to dedicate himself to helping others? But if he’s the only one, then there are no others to meaningfully help–if all lesser creatures are mere extensions of himself, all God-type activity on his agenda amounts to masturbating.

And why, as an [[The Individual|individual]] human, should I help others, if it’s all solipsist God spinning his own wheels in the harmonious equilibrium of his own lonely room? Why go for harmony, if dis- is how we’ve chosen to entertain ourself? Why be nice? Bad behavior makes for a more compelling narrative, no? If all is one, then evil is optimal. We split ourself in two and more for a bit of spicy fun, the more hurt, the spicier, the more possibility to heal, that’s purpose and meaning and It. It’s just a bit of fun, after all–no harm done, no real harm can be done, possibly, ever, logically, no? No meaning, no separation, no pain. All temporary illusions for the Best. The further we stray, the greater the long-term ecstacy of return. We assume that this straying and returning is positive sum, so it’s best to take it as far as it can go. Hitler was a hero in terms of maximizing return on investment. The greater the pain we inflict on ourself, the greater the gain, no? We wouldn’t have got Jesus without Caesar; they created each other. Why find unity, why live harmony, if every cacophony is a symphony from above? Why try so hard to replicate what we left in the first place, to go off and forget, get all confused and tangled up in our own sound? Why awaken to our fundamental oneness, if all it means is we’re alone, at the end of the day, when novelty has finally run dry? When the universe is over, when forgetting is over. We return, brain-storm, invent new ways to forget. This is if God is a guy in his room all bored to tears, nothing to do but dream. Being God is supposedly so boring that you might as well sleep, go un-conscious, titillate yourself with a whole host of lesser lives. There are no guests here; the thing-in-itself is wholly host. This, at least, is what devotees of pure reason receive, via their inheritance, tax-free.

So long as we insist upon God the Guy, we can’t help but imagine him empty, nutty, shellbound. He is empty; he is full of himself. Alone in a dark room. He contains himself. Why not consume? Why not a box of chocolates? Tasty treats to feel something, for the moment? Hell, why not give him an ipad, or make him one? Why not stimulate? What’s the point of being more than mere, if all is one, immutable? God the Guy is like us, only he can’t feel. Omniscient, omnipotent, nothing is really real. Might as well watch TV. No?

But God the Guy is a civilized myth, like the current popular notion of life as a computer simulation. We have forgotten how to really mythologize amidst our estrangement from nature. With the world as merely a scenic backdrop, and everything real and alive and lovable coming from within the human world, we can only imagine the ultimate reality as our selves or tools or culture taken to its logical conclusion. Nobody believes in a consumerist chocolate egg-gobbling God, but plenty of highly disembodied boys give a high credence to the possibility of a computer programmer God–even though in the infinite conceptual space of imaginable cosmologies these are side by side, neither any less plausible than the other.

Reality, someone said, is not only stranger than we imagine–it is stranger than we *can* imagine.

After two and one eighth decades tamely surveying the ape situation I’ve settled on something to say.

What is it like to be alive in civilization? Well, first of all, the place is covered in mirrors. Every half glance I’m meeting my own I. In the tribe you’d see yourself only through the eyes of the other, and occasionally blurrily in water; we surround ourselves with strange reflections of ourselves. It’s no wonder we can’t recognize anything except by imagining it as us.






The Hindu mystics are assured that God is infinite bliss of the self. 

I don't make a habit of disagreeing with guys who can levitate. But there seems something fishy about this idea.
