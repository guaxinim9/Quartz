It is a noble idea, and self-evidently (not to say trivially) true. But the ideal alone is bloodless. Think of the men of history for whom the universal brotherhood of man was the central passion and object of their lives, yet who couldn't maintain a friendship to save their lives. 

The ideal of the universal is dwarfed by the living particular.
